# OLA-POWERBI-DASHBOARD

🚕 **Ola Data Analytics Project – Power BI Dashboard**

I recently completed a data analytics project using SQL and Power BI to analyze Ola ride data. The goal was to uncover why users cancel rides, what drives revenue changes, and which vehicle types are most profitable.

🔍 Using SQL, I extracted insights from raw data, then built a fully interactive Power BI dashboard with five key pages:
- Overall Metrics  
- Revenue Analysis  
- Cancellation Insights  
- Ratings Overview  
- Vehicle Type Performance  

📈 This project addresses real challenges faced by ride-hailing companies—helping them understand customer behavior, optimize operations, and stay ahead of competitors.

Check out the full dashboard and breakdown on GitHub 👇

P.S. This is a project I made a while ago but was a little hesitant to post. Finally sharing it now—hope it resonates with others who love solving real-world problems through data! 🚀
